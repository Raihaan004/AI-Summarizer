## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine (v18.x or higher recommended).
- A free **Groq API Key**. You can get one from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
    - Install the necessary NPM packages:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a new file named `.env` in the `backend` directory.
    - Add your Groq API key to the `.env` file:
      ```
      GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YourSecretKeyGoesHere
      ```

3.  **You're done!** There is no installation required for the frontend.

### Running the Application

You will need two terminals running simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - In your first terminal, make sure you are in the `backend` directory.
    - Run the following command:
      ```bash
      node server.js
      ```
    - You should see the message: `Backend server is running successfully on http://localhost:3000`

2.  **Launch the Frontend:**
    - Navigate to the root directory of the project (`ai-summarizer`).
    - Find the `index.html` file.
    - Right-click on it and select "Open with" your favorite web browser (e.g., Google Chrome).

The application should now be running locally in your browser and fully connected to your backend.
